# makefile-type-cpp
squelette de makefile pour du cpp

1-  Put this Makekile your root's project's folder

2-  Type "mkir src includes"

3-  Put your .cpp in src and list them in the Makefile after "LST_SRCS = "
    Put your .hpp in includes and list them in the Makefile after "LST_INCLUDES = "
    
4-  Choose a binary name and replace it in the Makefile after "NAME = " (default is a.out)

If you have clock skew problems, it will disturb this Makefile behaviour. I've no clue about that yet.
